# This script is a hack. It lets you share relatively tiny folders
# with a huge variety of tools via a custom bash command.
#
# Usage:
#
# ```bash
# docker run --rm -it --name testtest nginx /bin/bash -c "$(./whisper.sh)"            # drops contents of current working dir to container
# ```
#
# ```bash
# docker run --rm -it --name testtest nginx /bin/bash -c "$(./whisper.sh README.md)"  # drops README.md to container
# ```
#
#
# CAVEATS:
#
# * There's an upper limit to the amount of data you can share. usually dictated by ARG_MAX or something similar
