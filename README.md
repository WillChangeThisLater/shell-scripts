## How to use these

### Debug
You need to be using tmux for this to work

```bash
[arch@archlinux chess]$ pacman -Sy netutils
error: you cannot perform this operation unless you are root.
[arch@archlinux chess]$ debug
Debugging. It might take 10-15 seconds for a response to appear
If you think the prompt is wrong check /tmp/prompt.txt"
If you want to change the prompt check ~/.bashrc

The most recent error in the session is:

error: you cannot perform this operation unless you are root.

This error occurs because the `pacman` command, which is used for package management in Arch Linux, requires root privileges to install or update packages.

To resolve this error, follow these steps:

1. **Run the command with superuser privileges:**
   You need to execute the `pacman` command with `sudo` to obtain the necessary root permissions. Try the following command:

   sudo pacman -Sy netutils

2. **Authenticate:**
   You will be prompted to enter your password to authenticate as a superuser. Type your password and press `Enter`.

3. **Installation:**
   If the password is correct and you have the necessary permissions, the package `netutils` will be installed or updated.

If you encounter any additional errors, check the output for specific messages and follow the instructions provided or consult the Arch Linux documentation or community for further assistance.

### Download Site
I use this a lot for long plane rides where I'm not sure I'll have wifi

```bash
./download-site.sh https://eli.thegreenplace.net/ # tweak the script settings to make sure you dont clobber the site
```

### Markdown
I use this to create CLI prompts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source ~/.bashrc # where ~/.bashrc runs an eval on markdown.sh
cat <<EOF
Explain how the following command works:

$(bash_markdown "ls | wc")
EOF
```

### Netutils
There are a couple functions in here.
The implementation of cidrrange is gross.

```bash
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ eval "$(./netutils.sh)"
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ cidrrange 10.0.0.1/28
10.0.0.0
10.0.0.1
10.0.0.2
10.0.0.3
10.0.0.4
10.0.0.5
10.0.0.6
10.0.0.7
10.0.0.8
10.0.0.9
10.0.0.10
10.0.0.11
10.0.0.12
10.0.0.13
10.0.0.14
10.0.0.15
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ incidr 10.0.1.0 10.0.0.1/28
no
```

### Remote setup
This is a weird one. It leverages some tricks with declare to
perform setup on a remote machine/container

There's probably some less hacky way of doing this but this way
seems to work.

```bash
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ docker run -it ubuntu /bin/sh -c "$(./remote-setup.sh)"

### Share
I use this to share files over local networks

Server:
```bash
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ ifconfig wlan0
wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.170  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255

[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ ./share.sh .

```

### Simple server
I used this for web dev sometimes

```bash
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ echo "<p>hello there!</p>" | ./simple-server.sh
-bash: !: event not found
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ echo "<p>hello there\!</p>" | ./simple-server.sh &
[1] 3846377
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ Serving HTTP on ::1 port 8000 (http://[::1]:8000/) ...
curl localhost:8000
::1 - - [30/Nov/2024 10:59:48] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
<p>hello there\!</p>
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ kill -9 3846377
[1]+  Killed                  echo "<p>hello there\!</p>" | ./simple-server.sh
```

### slink
I used this for symlinking scripts to my local system
Apparently you can also use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for this

```bash
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ which share
which: no share in (/home/arch/.local/bin:/home/arch/.local/bin:/home/arch/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv/shims:/home/arch/.pyenv/shims:/home/arch/.local/bin:/home/arch/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv/shims:/home/arch/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/lib/emscripten:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl:/usr/lib/emscripten)
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ sudo slink share.sh
[sudo] password for arch:
ln -s /home/arch/scripts/shell-scripts/share.sh /usr/local/bin/share
[arch@archlinux shell-scripts]$ which share
/usr/local/bin/share
```

### Transcribe
Currently only works on mac. Sometimes at work I'll take a screenshot of a slack thread
and I'll want to translate it to text

```bash
./transcribe.sh # on mac, this will translate your latest screenshot to text
```
