The most recent error in the session is:

```bash
error: you cannot perform this operation unless you are root.
```

This error occurs because the `pacman` command, which is used for package management in Arch Linux, requires root privileges to install or update packages.

To resolve this error, follow these steps:

1. **Run the command with superuser privileges:**
   You need to execute the `pacman` command with `sudo` to obtain the necessary root permissions. Try the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Sy netutils
   ```

2. **Authenticate:**
   You will be prompted to enter your password to authenticate as a superuser. Type your password and press `Enter`.

3. **Installation:**
   If the password is correct and you have the necessary permissions, the package `netutils` will be installed or updated.

If you encounter any additional errors, check the output for specific messages and follow the instructions provided or consult the Arch Linux documentation or community for further assistance.
